# rekhta-words
A very simple python script that fetches the word of the day along with its meaning from the urdu-english dictionary that is available on https://www.rekhta.org/


Python modules that need to be installed in order to run this script are:
	a. Beautiful Soup
	b. requests


Scheduling this script to run daily (Ex: Using cron on Linux) will append the word of the day into rekhta-words.txt file


I'll keep updating the text file occasionally.
